# GoTappa

A Cydia Substrate tweak, inspired by chpwn's long-discontinued ProTapper, which gives you a Palm Pre-style puck when you touch the screen.

Probably best explained visually rather than with words:

Especially useful for when recording your iPhone's screen with QuickTime or mirroring your screen over AirPlay, though it looks good any time.

When enabled, GoTappa runs in all apps (including SpringBoard), except for at the lock screen and Camera.app.

This tweak is loosely based on [Fingertips by Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/Fingertips).
